## BDD

A user of the application should be able to:

- View different photos that interest me.
- Click on a single photo to expand it and also view the details of the photo. - The photo details must appear on a modal within the same route as the main   page.
- Search for different categories of photos. (ie. Travel, Food)
- Copy a link to the photo to share with my friends.
- View photos based on the location they were taken.
